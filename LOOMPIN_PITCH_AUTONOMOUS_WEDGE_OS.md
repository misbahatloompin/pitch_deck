## 1. The Problem: The “Data-to-Action” Gap Is Where Revenue Leaks

Organizations generate massive amounts of customer signals:

- support tickets and chats
- call recordings and notes
- product usage and feature adoption
- surveys, reviews, and social sentiment
- CRM activity and renewal context

But most of that signal becomes **noise**, not action.

**Teams don’t lack data. They lack an operating system that turns signal into execution.**

| What you have today | What breaks |
|---|---|
| Data collection tools + dashboards | Insights arrive late and don’t change outcomes |
| Manual triage across departments | Slow response and inconsistent playbooks |
| Point automation scripts | Fragile, siloed, not measurable end-to-end |
| “AI copilots” in isolated apps | Helpful… but not coordinated across the business |

**The result:** customer issues compound silently, while teams stay busy and outcomes stay flat.

## 2. What LoomPin Is

### Autonomous Customer Intelligence — With Practical Constraints

LoomPin is an AI-native system that:

- **Unifies** customer signals into an account-level understanding
- **Detects** patterns and predicts what’s likely to happen next
- **Recommends** the next best action (with evidence and confidence)
- **Executes** within governed boundaries (approval flows, audit logs, limits)
- **Learns** from outcomes so the system improves over time

> **Most tools help you observe. LoomPin helps you operate.**

## 3. How It Works: From Signals to Outcomes

│  Connect the sources that matter most to your ICP (CRM, Support, Usage, Voice │
│  Surveys, Reviews). Normalize identities to the account level.                │

### Reliability & Safety (So it can run in the real world)
- Evidence and traceability (what signals drove the recommendation)
- Confidence indicators and suppression of low-quality noise
- Human approvals for sensitive actions
- Audit trails and rollback paths

## 4. The Wedge: Workflows That Pay for Themselves First

Autonomy is earned through ROI.

### 💰 Workflow 1: Churn Prevention (Account-level risk)
- detect early risk signals and drivers
- generate a playbook and route owners automatically
- measure lift in renewal outcomes

### 💰 Workflow 2: Support Cost Reduction (Deflection + triage)
- identify repeat issues and route fixes
- improve macros/KB/bot intents
- reduce ticket volume and escalations

### 💰 Workflow 3: Expansion Readiness (Opportunity signals)
- detect adoption + sentiment patterns that indicate expansion
- route upsell-ready signals to the right team
- improve timing and conversion

**These are the “pay for themselves” wedges. Everything else expands from here.**

---

## 5. Hero Workflow: “Make Support Deflection Self-Healing”

1) LoomPin detects the top recurring ticket drivers this week
2) It generates:
   - KB updates or drafts
   - macro changes
   - bot intent recommendations
3) It routes tasks:
   - Support ops gets the change set
   - Product gets the bug cluster and impact summary
4) Governance:
   - changes require approval before publishing
5) Outcomes tracked:
   - ticket deflection rate
   - time-to-resolution
   - sentiment trend

**The point isn’t AI content. It’s measurable operational improvement.**

---

## 6. Why LoomPin Wins (The Moat Is Execution)

### 1) Cross-Team Coordination
Most tools optimize one function (Support, CS, Marketing). LoomPin routes the right work across teams.

### 2) Compound Signal Understanding
It’s not “NPS is down.” It’s “NPS is down *because* feature adoption dropped *after* a rollout, and tickets spiked for a specific segment.”

### 3) Governed Autonomy
Automation that respects risk, approvals, and accountability.

### 4) Outcome-Driven Learning
If a playbook doesn’t work, the system learns. If it does, the routing gets stronger.

## 7. Competitive Landscape (Where We Fit)

- CX platforms: excellent at collection and reporting
- CDPs: excellent at identity and activation
- Point automations: fragile and siloed
- AI copilots: helpful in one app at a time

**LoomPin sits above the stack as the intelligence + action layer — starting with a wedge, expanding into the OS.**

---

## 8. Business Model

- Platform fee + usage tier
- Expansion through additional workflows, teams, and signal volume
- Add-on modules (voice intelligence, compliance pack, domain playbooks)

---

## 9. Traction (Fill with real proof)

Include:
- pilot deployments + time-to-value
- 1–2 quantified outcomes (hours saved, deflection, renewal lift)
- pipeline and conversion metrics
- customer quote

---

## 10. The Vision: Customer Intelligence as an Operating System

Most organizations will adopt autonomous systems in stages:

1) **Insight:** “What’s happening?”
2) **Recommendation:** “What should we do?”
3) **Supervised automation:** “Do it with approval.”
4) **Bounded autonomy:** “Do it within limits.”
5) **Operating system:** “Continuously run the best playbooks across the business.”

**LoomPin is built for that trajectory — and we start with the workflows that pay for themselves first.**

## 11. The Ask

Raising: **$[X]** to:
- productize wedge workflows into repeatable deployments
- strengthen governance + reliability controls
- scale GTM into **[ICP]**

**The future isn’t more dashboards. It’s customer intelligence that runs the business.**
