# LoomPin — Revenue Risk Early Warning System (Pitch)

> **LoomPin builds an early warning system for revenue risk — then routes the right playbook to the right team automatically.**
>
> _Revenue risk shows up in signals first. LoomPin catches it early — and makes the response operational._

## 1. The Problem: Revenue Risk Is Detected Too Late

Every growth team has the same reality:

- **Renewals slip** with little warning.
- **Expansion stalls** after product friction quietly compounds.
- **Support load spikes** right before churn.
- **Competitors enter** the account while the business is still “monitoring sentiment.”

Customer signals exist everywhere — tickets, calls, usage, surveys, reviews, sales notes — but they are **fragmented, noisy, and slow to operationalize**.

**The result:** teams debate what’s happening while revenue quietly walks out the door.

| What happens in real life | What it costs you |
|---|---|
| Signals are scattered across tools and teams | Risk is spotted late (or not at all) |
| Teams triage manually and inconsistently | High-value accounts get treated like “just another ticket” |
| Insights don’t translate into workflows | Even correct insights fail to change outcomes |
| Playbooks aren’t measured end-to-end | You don’t know what actually works |

**Dashboards describe the past. LoomPin changes what happens next.**

## 2. What LoomPin Is

### The Revenue Risk Early Warning System + Playbook Router

LoomPin is an AI-native system that:

- **Connects** the highest-signal customer sources (CRM, Support, Product Usage, Voice/Chat, Surveys, Social)
- **Detects** account-level risk patterns (single-signal and compound)
- **Explains** what changed and why it matters (with evidence and confidence)
- **Routes** the right playbook to the right team — *in the tools they already use*
- **Measures** outcomes end-to-end, so playbooks improve over time

Think of it like this:

> **Traditional CX tools show you the smoke. LoomPin finds the spark — and dispatches the fire crew.**

## 3. How It Works: The Risk-to-Response Loop

LoomPin is built around one loop: **Detect → Decide → Deliver → Learn**.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1) SIGNAL INGESTION                                                         │
│  Pulls structured + unstructured signals from key systems (tickets, calls,   │
│  notes, usage, surveys, reviews). Normalizes identities to the account level │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2) RISK DETECTION                                                           │

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4) PLAYBOOK ROUTING + GOVERNED EXECUTION                                    │

│  5) OUTCOME TRACKING                                                         │

### Levels of Autonomy (So this is practical in real orgs)

- **Level 0 — Insights:** evidence-backed briefs and risk scores
- **Level 1 — Recommendations:** next best actions + playbooks, one-click execution
- **Level 2 — Supervised automation:** approvals + audit trail for sensitive actions
- **Level 3 — Bounded autonomy:** pre-approved actions with limits, caps, and rollback

**LoomPin starts at the level your organization trusts — and earns the right to automate more.**

---

## 4. The Wedge: Retention + Support Efficiency (Fast Payback)

We start with the workflows that produce immediate ROI:

### ✅ Churn Early Warning (Accounts, not tickets)
- Detect risk 30–90 days before renewal windows close
- Identify *why* risk is rising (product friction, support breakdown, pricing stress, competitor entry)

### ✅ Support Escalation Triage (Signal → owner → response)
- Detect emerging severity patterns before they become exec escalations
- Route the right issue to the right owner with context and evidence

### ✅ Repeat-Issue Deflection (Stop the bleeding)
- Identify top recurring drivers of tickets and negative sentiment
- Trigger fixes: KB updates, macro improvements, bot intent tuning, product bug routing

---

## 5. Hero Workflow: “Pre-empt a Renewal Failure”

**Goal:** move from reactive churn to proactive recovery.

1) LoomPin detects a **compound risk pattern** in an account:
   - usage drop + rising negative ticket sentiment + competitor mention in call transcript
2) LoomPin generates an **Account Risk Brief**:
   - what changed, when, evidence, confidence, likely drivers
3) LoomPin routes the **right playbook**:
   - CSM tasks + support escalation + product bug ticket + exec sponsor outreach (as appropriate)
4) Governance controls:
   - sensitive actions require approval; low-risk steps can execute automatically
5) LoomPin tracks outcomes:
   - response time, risk trend, renewal outcome, playbook effectiveness

**This is not “more analytics.” This is operational response.**

## 6. Why LoomPin Wins (Without Becoming a “Feature Catalog”)

### 1) Compound Signal Detection
Most tools analyze each channel in isolation. LoomPin links signals at the account level and detects cross-channel patterns earlier.

### 2) Action in the Systems of Work
The value isn’t a dashboard — it’s *routing work* into Salesforce, Zendesk, Jira, Slack, etc.

### 3) Governance by Design
Approvals, audit trails, risk tiers, execution limits, and rollbacks — so automation is safe, not scary.

### 4) Learning Loop (What actually works)
Playbooks aren’t static documents. LoomPin measures outcomes and improves routing and recommendations over time.

## 7. Market

Revenue retention and customer operations are board-level priorities:
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR) pressure
- Rising support costs
- Competitive switching friction decreasing
- AI is shifting expectations from “insights” to “execution”

**The winner won’t be the team with the most feedback. It will be the team that acts fastest.**

---

## 8. Business Model (Simple, Expandable)

**Base platform** + **usage tier** + **modules**

- Platform fee (workspace / business unit / region)
- Usage tier (signals processed / seats / action volume)
- Add-on modules (risk detection packs, governance pack, voice intelligence, etc.)

Expansion happens naturally as:
- more sources connect
- more teams use playbooks
- more workflows automate

---

## 9. Traction (Fill with your real proof)

**What investors expect here:**
- Design partners / pilots (logos if approved)
- A concrete before/after story (one account or one workflow)
- Deployment time-to-value (days/weeks)
- Pipeline (LOIs, qualified opportunities)

---

## 10. Roadmap (Wedge → Platform)

- **Now:** retention + support workflows that pay back fast
- **Next:** broader customer intelligence routing (product growth, billing, onboarding)
- **Later:** a unified operating layer where customer signals continuously drive business execution

---

## 11. The Ask

Raising: **$[X]** to:
- scale pilots into repeatable deployments
- harden connectors + governance
- build a predictable go-to-market in **[ICP]**

**LoomPin makes revenue risk visible early — and makes the response automatic, measurable, and safe.**
